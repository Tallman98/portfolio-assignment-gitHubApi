# Frontend Second Semester Examination Project

This is my submission for the second semester examination project. It is a react app which fetches and displays all my github repositories along with other information associated with each repository.

The GitHub logo on the nav bar also serves as a button taking you back to the homepage. The profile picture to the right hand side of the nav bar was also fetched from the github api and displayed there.
